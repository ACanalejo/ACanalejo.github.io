I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Lucerne](https://www.unilu.ch/en/), where I contribute to the [SNSF](https://www.snf.ch/en)-funded project [DIGIPOL](https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/institutes-departements-and-research-centres/department-of-political-science/research/digitalization-and-political-conflict-parties-voters-and-electoral-alignment-digipol/) and serve as a Senior Researcher at the [Chair of Political Behavior and Communication](https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/institutes-departements-and-research-centres/department-of-political-science/staff/prof-dr-alexander-trechsel/#tab=c46508). I am also affiliated with the [Digital Society Initiative](https://www.dsi.uzh.ch/en.html) at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html).

## Research Interests
---

My research lies in the fields of comparative politics, political behavior, and public opinion, with a particular interest in the intersection of party politics, public attitudes, and behavior. I also have a keen interest in research design and methodology, particularly mixed-methods, experimental, and causal inference designs. Below is a summary of my main **research topics**.

<div style="margin-top: 40px;"></div>

#### Elections, Democracy, and Affective Polarization    

<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">
Since my doctoral studies, I have examined **how election outcomes under conditions of affective polarization shape democratic attitudes and behaviors**. My [dissertation](research/#thesis-anchor) argued that [while new party entry positively impacts democratic engagement](research/#parl-entry-anchor), [this effect is often overshadowed by hostility toward mainstream party winners](research/#radical-entry-anchor). Building on these findings, my current research explores whether [elections create a winner-loser gap among politicians](research/#elites-anchor) and [investigates the mechanisms driving the erosion of losers' consent in polarized societies](research/#losers-consent-anchor). Concerned about the negative implications of partisan animosity for democracy, I also study the potential of [depolarizing interventions in multi-party systems](research/#depol-survey-anchor), including the [effectiveness of tools such as Voting Advice Applications](research/#depol-euandi-anchor).

#### The Politics of Digitalization  

<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">
Following my PhD, I have developed a research agenda focused on the politics of digitalization. Moving from the supply to the demand side of electoral politics, the adoption of digital technologies has proven to effect electoral behavior, but its politicization has been limited nevertheless. In the DIGIPOL project we investigate **whether [digitalization creates fertile ground for a new political conflict](research/#digipol-demand-anchor)** and [how political parties address digitalization issues](research/#digipol-supply-anchor), an increasingly pressing topic given the shift toward AI.

#### Spanish Politics and Regional Identities  

<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">
Finally, I have a keen interest in Spanish politics ([1](research/#salf-anchor), [2](research/#new-party-anchor)), particularly **the role of [multiple national and regional identities in shaping political behavior and democratic commitment](research/#regional-anchor)**. My research seeks to deepen our understanding of how these overlapping identities contribute to political disaffection and explore whether the design of asymmetric federal institutions can mitigate such challenges.
