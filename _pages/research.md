- Small Grant Aarhus University (**35,000 DKK**), with Morgan Le Corre Juratic (2024)

- UniLu FoKo Funding (**12,231 CHF**), with Alberto López Ortega and Javier Padilla Moreno-Torres (2023)

## Additional Research Team Experience

&nbsp; <a id="digipol-anchor"></a>Since 2022, I have been part of the project [DIGIPOL](https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/institutes-departements-and-research-centres/department-of-political-science/research/digitalization-and-political-conflict-parties-voters-and-electoral-alignment-digipol/), funded by the [Swiss National Science Foundation](https://www.snf.ch/en) and led by Prof. Alexander H. Trechsel. DIGIPOL explores the early politicization—or lack thereof—of digitalization issues from both the demand and supply sides, with a specific focus on Switzerland. Since June 2023, I have served as the Scientific Coordinator of the project.


&nbsp; <a id="euandi-anchor"></a>From December 2023 to July 2024, I have been part of the [EU&I 2024](https://euandi.eu/en/about/overview.html) project as a member of its Scientific Committee. This project, based at the EUI, developed a cross-national Voting Advice Application for the 2024 European Parliament Election, reaching almost 2 million users. The project has produced valuable party and VAA-user-level data, as well as experimental results on the effect of VAAs on various outcomes (see Work in Progress above).

&nbsp; Additionally, I have worked as a country expert and research assistant in numerous projects since my undergraduate studies, including ERC projects such as [SOLID](https://solid-erc.eu/) and [POLCON](https://www.eui.eu/projects/polcon), as well as [EUANDI2019](https://euandi2019.eu/survey/default/EN). Other projects focused on Spanish politics include [¿Por qué odiamos la política?](https://www.iesa.csic.es/proyectos/por-que-odiamos-la-politica/), [Parlamentarios y Sociedad](https://www.upo.es/investiga/ptyp/es/project/parlamentarios-y-sociedad/), and [ICOSOP](https://www.upo.es/investiga/ptyp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ICOSOP_Informe_seguimiento_3.pdf).
